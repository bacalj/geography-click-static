Netlify's ["dusty domains"](https://dusty.domains/) charity event came along so I'm getting this out the door in less-than-perfect shape.  

I am working on finding a map with Palestinian Territories that works with Highcharts that does not have a super-distored projection.  If you know of one, let me know.
